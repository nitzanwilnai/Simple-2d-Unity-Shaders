# Simple, 2d, Unity shaders

Tint Shader - A shader that let's you change the colors of the red, green and blue channels in a texture.
Resize Shader - A shader that let's you resize the texture. You can set the x and y axis scale, and the alignment so the scale happens from the center, top, right, bottom, or left side.
Resize Atlas Shader - A shader that let's you resize textures that are imported from a texture atlas.
Outline Shader - A shader that let's you add an outline around an image. You can set the outline color and the width of the outline. Similar to the "stroke" feature in Photoshop.
Dual Texture Tint - A tint shader that let's you mix two different tint textures.
Dual Texture Atlas Tint - A tint shader that let's you mix two different tint textures, both imported from a texture atlas.

A bunch of simple, 2d, Unity shaders.

Note! You have to make sure all your imported textures have their mesh type set to Full Rect.
Sprite Mode -> Mesh Type -> Full Rect
